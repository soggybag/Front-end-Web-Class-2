### 1 - What is CSS? 

- CSS enforces the separation of content and presentation. 
- CSS is a language of visual description. 
- CSS is super powerful it can: 
  - Set the font, size, color, line spacing, etc
  - Set the size, position and layout of elements in a page
  - Set image and color fills, border styles, size and position
  - Animate elements on a page
  - Apply styles for interactive states
  
(an element is a tag and all of it's contents)

### 2 - Diagnostic quiz

### 3 - Pair up and check your answers

### 4 - CSS syntax, Selectors, Properties, and Values

- Not case sensitive, you should stick with lowercase
- A CSS Rule is built
  - A selector
  - Containing one or more property value pairs
- CSS can live in
  - CSS file with the extension .css
  - In the style tag
  - In the style attribute
    - This is the least useful save it for special occasions
    - The selector is implied 
    
### 5 - Example Style

There are hudnereds of CSS style properties. See the list for yourself: 
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). 
Don't feel you need to know all of these yet. We will be looking at important CSS properties in future classes.

### 6 - Take a Break

### 7 - Learn the power of selectors take the Test: https://flukeout.github.io

There are many many selectors. You don’t need them all. Don’t feel you have use them all at the beginning. 
Here are the most common selectors that you will use often:

- Tag selector
- Class selector
- Descendant selector
- Child selector

### 9 - Style your work

  - Challenge: Use only tag selectors along with descendant and child selectors

- Try these CSS style properties:
  - font-size
  - font-family
  - color (sets the color of text)
  - line-height
  - font-weight
  - background-color
  - Find some other properties and have fun!

## Projects and Challenges

The style guide is something we will continue to work on and improve. At this stage you will not have enough information 
to do all of the things you may think of, that’s okay. We will be talking about new things you can add to your style guide 
as the class progresses. 

- Make a style guide (chose one or more the markup examples)
  - Identify each of the uniquely styled elements in your HTML document
    - Use one or more of the projects from the previous class
    - Separate the elements and create specimens in an HTML file
      - Colors
      - Default font style
      - Heading
      - Sub headings
      - Call outs
      - Block quote
      - Image
      - Header
  - Define styles for common text content tags: 
    - p, h1-6, blockquote, strong, em, a
  - Challenge: Style form elements
  - Challenge: Create a sample style guide page with code samples and specimens
    - In order to create code samples in HTML you will to understand 
      - HTML entities
      - Code and pre tags
- Create a style guide for the screenplay. 
  - The best approach here is to use class names for things like: voice-over, screen direction, character name and other things that are specific to screen plays and don’t have an existing tag. 
- Make some really great buttons
  - Use the <button> tag and set the styles to make it look really cool
  - Take a look at the button examples here and see if you can recreate them or make your own version: [https://www.freshdesignweb.com/css3-buttons/](https://www.freshdesignweb.com/css3-buttons/) to recreate these you will need more CSS than we have covered so far, that’s okay, try it on your own and push yourself.
